# Copy - Flight

This is a personal project, a really watered down copy of the Google Flights web application using [Vite.js w/ React](https://vite.dev/) with [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

API used to extract flight data was [Air Scrapper](https://rapidapi.com/apiheya/api/sky-scrapper)

To install and use locally:

 - Clone the repo
 - `cd` into the repository and use `npm install` to install dependencies
 - Use `npm run dev` to run locally
 - ### NOTE:  
	 - Create a `.env` file in the repository's root with the key `VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY` containing your Air Scraper API key, to get one you need to create an account in [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)
 
 ### Application is not optimized to run in a production environment
